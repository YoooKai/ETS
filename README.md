# Dungeons & Dragons

### 5th Edition

![Header](dnd_home_phb_bannerv4.png)

<p>Dungeons & Dragons was first published in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, when they were seeking to create a game that focused on personalized battles with individual heroes. The 1st edition of the game was mailed in a faux wood colored cardboard box that contained three adventure booklets: Men & Magic, Monsters & Treasure, and Underworld & Wilderness Adventures. 40 years of adventure later, the 5th edition was released and kicked off the roleplaying renaissance that we’re seeing today.</p>

## How does it work?

The core of D&D is about storytelling. The group of players essentially tell a collective story, guiding heroes through dangerous quests to search for treasure, battle deadly foes, and even carry out daring rescues.

The adventure itself is only limited by the imagination of the players around the table. All that you really need to get started is a group of friends, a few supplies, and a good Dungeon Master.

## Video-Guide to fill your character sheet! :blush:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVAJrYOOtwI&t=35s" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IVAJrYOOtwI/maxresdefault.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="540" height="290" border="10" /></a>

Creating your first D&D character sheet can initially feel like navigating a labyrinth of rules, numbers, and choices. The plethora of races, classes, backgrounds, and skills may seem overwhelming to newcomers. Selecting the perfect combination for your character's personality, abilities, and backstory involves making decisions that may feel like entering uncharted territory. However, as you delve deeper into the process, you start to appreciate the creative freedom it offers. With each decision, whether it's choosing a race, class, or determining your character's alignment, you become more adept at crafting a unique persona. Over time, the once daunting task transforms into an enjoyable and imaginative exercise. The process not only fosters a deeper connection to your character but also cultivates a sense of accomplishment as you witness your creation come to life in the fantastical world of D&D. As you gain experience, filling out subsequent character sheets becomes a delightful ritual, making the journey of character creation an integral and rewarding aspect of the D&D experience.

## D20 Rolling Code in Python

You can also create programs easily to simulate dice rolling and play DND with your friends online. For example:

- Code to reoll a d20:

```python
import random

def roll_d20():
    return random.randint(1, 20)

# Example usage
result = roll_d20()
print(f"Rolling a d20: {result}")

```

- Code to roll a d8:

```python
import random

def roll_d8():
    return random.randint(1, 8)

# Example usage
result = roll_d8()
print(f"The result of rolling a d8 is: {result}")


```

- You can also practise XML by writing your character characteristics in a file, for example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<character>
    <name>Gandalf the Grey</name>
    <class>Wizard</class>
    <level>10</level>
    <race>Human</race>
    <alignment>Neutral Good</alignment>
    <background>Grey Pilgrim</background>
    <attributes>
        <strength>12</strength>
        <dexterity>14</dexterity>
        <constitution>10</constitution>
        <intelligence>18</intelligence>
        <wisdom>16</wisdom>
        <charisma>16</charisma>
    </attributes>
    <equipment>
        <weapon>Staff of Power</weapon>
        <armor>Robes of the Archmagi</armor>
        <item>Ring of Fire Resistance</item>
    </equipment>
</character>

```
